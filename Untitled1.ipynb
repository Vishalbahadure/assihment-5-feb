    "Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",

    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes or properties) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It allows you to control access to the internal state of an object by defining access modifiers (public, private, protected), ensuring that data is accessed and modified in a controlled way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reuse and the creation of a hierarchy of classes, where subclasses can extend or override the functionality of their parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows you to write code that can work with objects of various types without needing to know their specific types at compile time. Polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding and interfaces (in languages like Java) and promotes flexibility and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors while hiding unnecessary details. It allows you to create abstract classes and methods that define a blueprint for derived classes. Abstraction helps in managing complexity and focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",

    "Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "The __init__() function, also known as the constructor, is used in Python to initialize the attributes (properties or variables) of an object when it is created from a class. It is a special method in Python and gets automatically called when you create a new instance (object) of a class. The purpose of the __init__() function is to set up the initial state of the object by assigning values to its attributes.\n",

    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "Differentiating Instance Variables: Within a class, self is used to distinguish instance variables (attributes that belong to a specific object) from local variables (variables that are local to a specific method). This allows you to work with the object's own data.\n",
